## Remote Vehicle Breakdown Assistance (RVBA)

**Final Year Degree Project**

This repository holds the code for my final degree project, RVBA - a mobile application-based Remote Vehicle Breakdown Assistance system. Developed as a team project intern at Softroniix with the help and guidance of mentors, RVBA aims to revolutionize roadside assistance, particularly in remote locations. Completely made with flutter and backend integrated with firebase, FIrestore is used for database
